# 0.5.0-rc.0 / 2022-09-29

This is the first release of whizard.

## What's new

Whizard is a distributed cloud observability platform that provides unified observability (currently monitoring and alerting) for Multi-Cloud, On-Premise and Edge infrastructures and applications.

### Kubernetes native deployment and management

The Whizard Controller Manager simplifies and automates the configuration and deployment of the whizard components by the following CRDs:  

* `Compactor`: Defines the Compactor component, which does the block compaction and life cycle management for the object storages.
* `Gateway`: Defines the Gateway component, which provides an unified entrypoints for metrics read and write requests.
* `Ingester`: Defines the Ingester component, which receives metrics data from routers, caches data in memory, flushs data to disk, and finally uploads metrics blocks to object storage.
* `Query`: Defines the Query component, which fetches data from the ingesters and/or stores and then evaluates the query.
* `QueryFrontend`: Defines the Query Frontend component, which improves the query performance by request spliting and result caching.
* `Router`: Defines the Router component, which routes and replicates the metrics to the ingesters.
* `Ruler`: Defines the Ruler component, which evaluates recording and alerting rules.
* `Service`: Defines a Whizard Service, which connects different whizard components together to provide a complete monitoring service. It also contains shared configurations of different components.
* `Storage`: Defines the Storage instance, which contains the object storage configuration, and a block manager component for the block inspection and GC.
* `Store`: Defines the Store instance, which facilitates metrics reads from the object storage.
* `Tenant`: Defines a tenant which is the basic unit of resource isolation and auto scaling.  

### Multi-tenancy and Auto scaling

* Whizard components support multi-tenancy and are able to auto scale.
* The store component supports to auto scale based on its actual load.
* The ruler component also can also scale based on rule group sharding for a single tenant with too many rules.  

### Data management and GC

* Whizard provides metrics data life cycle management for data on disk or in object storage. If a tenant is deleted, Whizard can automatically cleanup this tenant's blocks in the object storage or on local disk.

### Others

* Whizard also has an agent proxy component that implements the Prometheus HTTP v1 API (reads/writes), which can be used as a data collection agent and a query proxy.
